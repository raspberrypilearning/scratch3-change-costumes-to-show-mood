You can use `switch costume to`{:class="block3looks"} blocks before and after a `say for`{:class="block3looks"}, `think for`{:class="block3looks"}, `play sound`{:class="block3sound"}, or `wait`{:class="block3control"} block to make your character show their feelings.

```blocks3
switch costume to [abby-a v] // starting costume
wait [1] seconds
switch costume to [abby-b v] // show feelings
think [Hmm...] for [2] seconds
switch costume to [abby-a v] // back to starting costume
```

**Tip:** Make sure that you use a block that has a time value, not a `start sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `say`{:class="block3looks"}, or `think`{:class="block3looks"} block, otherwise, you will not see the costume change.
